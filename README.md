### GUI related suite of puredata patches and abstractions made to create more complex UI elements in plugdata.

Designed specifically for high customizability, but less flexible. basic versions for sketching/prototyping will be available.

Made with and primarily for plugdata, but intended to function in vanilla, as long as the ELSE library is installed. 
Due to improvements of the render engine in plugdata, performance in vanilla may wary. 

### Roadmap
- [ ] fully fledged dropdown menu (current project)
- [ ] basic tabs
- [ ] dynamic tabs with ability to create new tabs
- [ ] list that can be re-ordered with drag and drop (for FX order)
- [ ] modern wireless drag and drop modulation system
